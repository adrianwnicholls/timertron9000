This is an exercise timer. I created it so that I don't have to keep an eye on the stopwatch whilst doing some exercises.
It gives a beep after each rep and 2 after a set, it displays the name of the current exercise. 
You can see what it looks like in images/Screenshot.jpg file. It's a tkinter python app.
It's pretty much a minimal viable product for my own use only. I have ideas to improve it but it does the job I needed it to do so I'll probably leave it as is.
I didn't spend any time making it particularly pretty, I just needed a pragmatic solution.
