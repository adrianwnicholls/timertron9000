This is an exercise timer. I created it so that I don't have to keep an eye on the stopwatch whilst doing some exercises.
It gives a beep after each rep and 2 after a set, it displays the name of the current exercise. 
You can see what it looks like in images/Screenshot.jpg file. It's a tkinter python app.
It's pretty much a minimal viable product for my own use only. I have ideas to improve it but it does the job I needed it to do so I'll probably leave it as is.
I didn't spend any time making it particularly pretty, I just needed a pragmatic solution. 


Ideas:
- Make the number of sets, length of rep, name of exercise/activity  configurable.
- Make it log the run into a file, perhaps json, perhaps to google sheets.
- Alternatively pixela might be a nice way to do it. ( I like the idea of this just for fun.)
- Make the end of exercise/rep notification configurable. 
- Have text to speach on activity name etc.
- Have multiple lists of activity. 
- Optional audio countdown timer. 
- Android it.
